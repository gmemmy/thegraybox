# Gray Box â€” React Native Animated Interactions

This repo is a small compendium of animated interactions in React Native that I find fun to build and iterate on. It's an [Expo](https://expo.dev) app using [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/) with [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) and [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/).

## Demos

All demos live under `app/demos`:

- `glass-tabs/`: Glassy tab bar with blur and springy transitions
- `nike/`: Product detail card, color/size selectors, and an options sheet interaction
  - Shared-element-style transition to Product Details using `react-native-screen-transitions` with Expo Router
  - Emphasized screen transition (scale/translate/overlay) configured via `lib/animation/transitions.ts`
  - Card swipe down gesture to reveal bottom sheet
- `parallax-header/`: Collapsing header with parallax image and sticky content

## Run it

1. Install deps

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

Then choose a target:

- iOS Simulator: `npx ios`
- Android Emulator: `npx android`

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction). New demos can be added by creating a folder under `app/demos/` and exporting a screen from `index.tsx`.

## Tech

- React Native + Expo
- Expo Router
- React Native Reanimated 3
- React Native Gesture Handler
- Expo modules: Blur, Haptics, Image, Symbols, Status Bar

Built for learning, exploration, and fun. Inspirations come from various product UIs and motion studies across the community.
